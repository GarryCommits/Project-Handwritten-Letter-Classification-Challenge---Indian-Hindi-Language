Project Objective: Handwritten Letter Classification Challenge

The objective of this project is to design and develop a machine learning model capable of classifying handwritten images of 10 distinct letters from one of the Indian languages. The project will follow a structured approach involving data collection, dimensionality reduction, and classification using modern machine learning techniques. The key goals of the project are:

1. Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of handwritten letter images representing 10 different letters from an Indian language, ensuring correct labeling and adequate class balance.

2. Data Preparation: Perform preprocessing such as image resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization, and label encoding to make the data suitable for training machine learning models.

3. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the complexity of the image data and improve model performance and visualization.

4. Model Development: Train and evaluate two classification models—Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN)—on the preprocessed data.

5. Model Tuning: Optimize model parameters and hyperparameters using tuning techniques such as Grid Search and validation strategies to improve classification accuracy.

6. Model Evaluation: Assess the models on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualize the results with tools like confusion matrices.

7. Final Demonstration: Present a working prototype of the classification system along with a detailed explanation of the process, results, and findings.

This project not only demonstrates the practical implementation of machine learning techniques on real-world image data but also emphasizes the importance of systematic development, evaluation, and fine-tuning of models in achieving high-performance classification systems.
